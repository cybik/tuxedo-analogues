# List of known Linux Vendor Laptop Analogues

## Why?

Just my way of trying to make some stuff clear. Like, work from [@System76](https://github.com/system76) or [@TUXEDOComputers](https://github.com/tuxedocomputers/) could be drop-in reusable if installed in another vendor's laptop. In such a case, one would have an "easy" time updating/customising/altering/genericizing the "upstream" tools to a more vendor-neutral/generalized UI that can then be customised to each vendor's specifications.

# Actual List

## Stellaris 15

The [TUXEDO Stellaris 15](https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/en/Linux-Hardware/Linux-Notebooks/15-16-inch/TUXEDO-Stellaris-15-Gen3.tuxedo) is a Clevo base with an interesting set of options, from CPU (intel ***and*** AMD) to GPU (GeForce RTX 30xx, multiple options). This entry may be renamed to the ODM name.
